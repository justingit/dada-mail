Dada Mail

=head1 INTRODUCTION

Dada Mail is a completely contemporary, mature and intuitive web-based
e-mail list management system, which runs on most any Unix-like hosting
account that can run custom CGI scripts.

Dada Mail handles Closed-Loop Opt-in/Opt-out subscriptions, sending
complex announce-only and/or discussion mailing list messages with an
advanced, fault-tolerant mass mailing monitor, supports the
archiving/viewing/searching/resending/syndicating (rss, atom feeds,
Twitter) of sent messages and doing all this and a whole lot more with
style.

Dada Mail can handle custom subscriber fields and you can use the
information it captures for partial list sending based on a query and
Dada Mail's email templating system allows you to create targeted and
completely custom email messages for each and every one one of your
subscribers.

Dada Mail is bundled with additional plugins and extensions to extend
Dada Mail's capabilities. Some of the plugins/extensions support
advanced bounce handling, clickthrough tracking, mass mail scheduling,
blog interfaces of archived messages, AJAX subscription form trickery
and lots of other surprises.

Dada Mail produces XHTML valid web content and sticks to best practices
when creating email messages. Write Once: Distribute Everywhere. Dada
Mail is free software that you're able to use, modify, share and enhance
under the terms of the GNU General Public License. Dada Mail is written
in Perl because we love Perl.
