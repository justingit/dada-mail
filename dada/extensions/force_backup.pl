=head1 NAME force_backup.cgi

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<force_backup.cgi> is very small utility script that will create a backup of 
Mailing List Settings and Mailing List Archives for Dada Mail Mailing Lists 
that use the default, C<Db> backened. 

=head1 INSTALLATION

Place this script in the same directory as the, C<mail.cgi> file. Change its
permissions to, C<755> and visit the script in your web browser. 

This will run the script and create the backups. 

=head1 SHORTCOMINGS

This script will only make backups for the default C<Db> backend for Mailing 
List Settings and Mailing List Archives. It probably won't do anything if you
are running the SQL backend.
