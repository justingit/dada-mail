dada_backup.pl - a simple list backup utility for Dada Mail

=head1 Directions: 

=over

=item Where are your Perl Libraries? 

Since this script is supposed to be run via a cron job, (although it 
will work fine using from the command line) you usually have to type 
the entire path to your Perl Libraries. 

example: 

	use lib '/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.005/';	

=cut

use lib qw(
	../ 
	../DADA/perllib 
	../../../../perl 
	../../../../perllib
);

=pod

=item Where are Dada Mail's Libraries? 

Dada Mail uses variables that are located in the Config.pm file 
to figure out where the lists are, among other things. 

example:

	use lib '/usr/home/account/public_html/cgi-bin/dada'; 

=cut

use lib qw(
/usr/home/account/public_html/cgi-bin/dada
/usr/home/account/public_html/cgi-bin/dada/DADA
/usr/home/account/public_html/cgi-bin/dada/DADA/perllib
);

=pod

=item Where are the backup files going? 

Makes sure this script has  read and write permisssions to this directory

example:

	my $backup_lists = '/home/account/.dada_files/.backups'; 

=cut

my $backup_lists = '/home/account/.dada_files/.backups'; 

=pod

=item Where is the backup log? 

dada_backup.pl will keep a log of what it's doing so you're not left in the dark if 
something goes awry

example:

	my $dada_backup_log = "$backup_lists/dada_backup.log"; 

=cut

my $dada_backup_log = "$backup_lists/dada_backup.log"; 

=pod


=item When should dada_backup.pl remove old files? 

It'll remove EVERYTHING in the $backup_lists directory except the backup log, 
if it finds it. This is in days:

example:

	my $remove_after = 1; 

=cut

my $remove_after = 7; 

=pod

=item  How do you want your backup lists named?

Things in brackets will be replaced with what they really are, so 
[year] will be replaced with 2001, etc

you have 

	[list_name] [year] [month] [day] [hour] [minute] [second]

to choose from

example:

	my $backup_name = '[list_name].list-[year][month][day][hour][minute][second]';

=cut
 
my $backup_name = '[list_name].list-[year][month][day][hour][minute][second]';

=pod

=item Want to send this backup report to someone?

place their e-mail address in this variable, and they'll get a copy as well

example:

	my $email_log_to = 'you@here.com'; 

=cut

my $email_log_to; 

=pod

=item Echo? 

Finally, if you run this script interactively quite a bit, you may want 
to have a copy of the report printed out  in the terminal, so you can 
figure out what's going on, just set this variable to 1;

example: 

	my $echo_log = 0; 


=back 

=cut

my $echo_log = 1;

=head1 Changes


=head2 Version 1.2

commented out the list_copy subroutine... since, it wasn't being used anyways!

=head2 Version 1.1

Changes were made to the script to specifically not look at directories. The problem is, 
as of version 2.8.12 of the script, a backup directory could in fact have a backup directory per list
with list setting and archive information, that would muck up this script. In the future, more integration 
should be done with this script and the other backup model.
