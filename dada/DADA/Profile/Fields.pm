=head1 NAME 

DADA::Profile::Fields

=head1 SYNOPSIS


=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 Public Methods

=head2 new

 my $pf = DADA::Profile::Fields->new

C<new> requires no paramaters.

A C<DADA::Profile::Fields> object will be returned. 

=head2 insert

 $df->insert(
 { 
	-email => 'user@example.com',
 }	
 ); 

C<insert> inserts a new record into the profile table. This method requires a few paramaters: 

C<-email> is required and should hold a valid email address in the form of: C<user@example.com>

C<-fields> holds the Subscriber Profile Fields passed as a hashref. It is an optional paramater. 

C<-mode> sets the way the new profile will be created and can either be set to, C<writeover> or, C<preserve>

When set to, C<writeover>, any existing profile belonging to the email passed in the <-email> paramater will be clobbered. 

When set to, C<preserve>, this method will first look and see if an already existing profile exists and if so, will not create a new one, but simply exit the method. 

C<writeover> is the default, if no paramater is passed. 

C<-confirmed> confirmed can also be passed with a value of either C<1> or, C<0>, with C<1> being the default if the paramater is not passed. 

Unconfirmed profiles are marked as existing, but not, "live" as a way to save the profile information, until the profile can be confirmed, by a user. 

This method should return, C<1> on success.  

=head2 get

 my $prof = $pf->get; 

C<get> returns the Subscriber Profile Fields for the email address passed in, C<-email> as a hashref. 

C<-email> is a required paramater. Not passing it will cause this method to return, C<undef>. 

Passing an email that doesn't have a profile saved will also return, C<undef>. Check before by using, C<exists()>

C<-dotted> is an optional paramter, and will return the keys of the hashref appended with, C<subscriber.>

=head2 exists

	my $exists = $pf->exists(
		{
			-email => 'user@example.com', 
		}
	); 

C<exists> return either C<1>, if the profile associated with the email address passed in the C<-email> paramater has a profile

or, C<0> if there is no profile. 

=head2 remove


 $pf->remove(
	{
		-email => 'user@example.com', 
	}
 ); 

C<remove> removes the Subscriber Profile Fields assocaited with the email address passed in the 
C<-email> paramater. 

C<remove> will return the number of rows removed - this should hopefully be only C<1>. Any larger number 
would be a serious problem. 

C<-email> is a required paramater. Not passing it will cause this method to return, C<undef>. 

Passing an email that doesn't have a profile saved will also return, C<undef>. Check before by using, C<exists()>
