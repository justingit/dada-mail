=head1 NAME 

DADA::ProfileFieldsManager

=head1 SYNOPSIS


=head1 DESCRIPTION


=head1 Public Methods

=head2 new

 my $pfm = DADA::ProfileFieldsManager->new

C<new> requires no paramaters.

A C<DADA::ProfileFieldsManager> object will be returned. 

=head2 fields 

 my $fields = $pfm->fields; 

C<fields> returns an array ref of the names of the columns that represent the Subscriber Profile Fields currently created. 

C<fields> returns the fields in the order they are usually stored in the SQL table. 

C<fields> requires no paramaters. 

=head2 add_field

 $pfm->add_field(
	{
		-field          => 'myfield', 
		-fallback_value => 'a default', 
		-label          => 'My Field!', 
	}
 ); 

C<add_field()> adds a field to the profile_fields table. 

C<-field> is a required paramater and should be the name of the field you want to 
create. This field has to be a valid column name for whatever backend you're using. 
It's suggested that you stick with lowercase, less than 16 character names. 

Not passing a name for your field in the C<-field> paramater will cause the an unrecoverable error.

C<-fallback_value> is an optional paramater, it's a more free form value, used when the profile does not have a value for this profile field. This is usually used in templating

C<-label> is an optional paramater and is used in forms that capture Subscriber Profile Fields information as a, "friendlier" version of the field name. 

This method will return C<undef> if there's a problem with the paramaters passed. See also the, C<validate_subscriber_field_name()> method. 

=head2 save_field_attributes

 $pfm->save_field_attributes(
	{  
		-field 			=> 'myfield', 
		-fallback_value => 'a default', 
		-label          => 'My Field!',
	}
 );

Similar to C<add_field()>, C<save_field_attributes()> saves the fallback value and label for a field. It will not create a new field, 
but will error if you attempt to save a field attribute to a field that does not exist. 

=head2 edit_field

   	$pfm->edit_field(
		{
			-old_name => 'myfield' ,
			-new_name => 'mynewname',
		}
	);	
	
C<edit_subscriber_field()> is used to rename a subscriber field. Usually, this means that a column is renamed in table. 
Various SQL backends do this differently and this method should provide the necessary magic. 

C<-old_name> and C<-new_name> are required paramaters and the method will croak if you do not 
pass both. 

This method will also croak if either the C<-old_name> does not exist, or the C<-new_name> exists. 

=head2 remove_field 

 $pfm->remove_field(
	{ 
		-field => 'myfield', 
	}
 ); 

C<remove_field> will remove the profile field passed in, C<-field>. 

C<-field> must exist, or the method will croak. 

=head2 change_field_order

 $pfm->change_field_order(
	{
		-field     => 'myfield', 
		-direction => 'down', # or, 'up' 
	}
 );

C<change_field_order> is used to change the ordering of the Subscriber Profile Fields. Subscriber Profile Fields
are usually in the order as they are stored in the SQL table and this method actually changes that 
order itself. 

This method is not available for the SQLite or PostgreSQL backend. 

C<-field> should hold the name of the field you'd like to move. 

C<-direction> should be either C<up> or, <down> to denote which direction you'd like the field to be 
moved. Movements are not circular - if you attempt to push a field down and the field is already the last field, it'll stay 
the last field and won't pop to the top of the stack. 

This method should return, C<1>, but if a field cannot be moved, it will return, C<0> 

This method will also croak if you pass a field that does not exist, or if you pass no field at all.
