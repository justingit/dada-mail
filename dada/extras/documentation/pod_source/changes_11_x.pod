=head1 11.8.0

=head2 Features

=head3 Unique Opens/Clickthroughs Analytics Restored! Now using anonymized data 

When v11.0.0 was released, it removed the ability to collect Personally Identifiable Information, to help people running 
mailing lists with Dada Mail conform closely to the GDPR. Not collecting this information made it difficult to create various 
reports in the Tracker plugin. For example in v11.0.0, we could see show you how many times a message you had sent had been opened, but we couldn't tell specifically how many subscribers opened the messages. The app may have recorded, "100" opens, but that could have been 1 subscriber opening it 100 times, or 100 subscribers opening it once. 

In versions that followed, we re-added the ability to save email address with the data collected to create analytic reports (by default: this is disabled), but this doesn't solve the problem if you need to run a mailing list that conforms to the GDPR. 

In v11.8.0, we've added a new option (which will be the new default): data like opens/clickthroughs that are recorded can now be recorded with an anonymized UID (rather than with the subscriber's email address). Never would the app know which subscriber opened/clicked a link, but we can differentiate between one subscriber and another, allowing us to compile much better analytic reports. This anonymoized UID is never, ever saved with the email address that it corresponds to, and changes per subscriber for each mass mailing sent out. 

=head3 Better Analytic Graphs/Tables in Tracker

With the restoration of being able to capture and report data, we've revisted the main graphs and tables presented in the Tracker plugin, 
and redesigned them to be easier to read, as well as more useful. 

The main graph has been changed from a line to a mixed line/bar graph. The total number of recipients sent your mass mailings is represented in the line graph, allowing one to easily see the changes in your subscription size as your various campaigns are sent. 

This acts likes a ceiling for the rest of the information:  Opens, Clickthroughs, Delivery Issues, and Unsubscriptions, which are shown in a group bar chart. 

There are two modes to this graph: the default mode shows the unqiue amounts of all these topics; the second shows them as a percentage of the total. Usually the total is the total number of recipients that are sent your mass mailing.

The table below this graph now shows data in total amounts, unique amounts and percent of the unique of the total for each mass mailing sent out. This table is also now sortable by each column presented. 

=head1 11.7.0

=head2 Features

=head3 Bridge Announcement List and Authorized Senders Enhancements

The Bridge plugin allows you to send messages with Dada Mail through your mail reader without having to log into Dada Mail's own list control panel. You can set up a list of Authorized Senders who are allowed to send to the mailing list. This is an easy way to allow more than just the List Owner the ability to send to your mailing list, without needing to give out your 
mailing list's administration credentials to anyone else. 

We have added several features to allow you to send more effective announce-only messages through Bridge: 

=head4 Rewrite From: Header Correctly

The first change we've made is actually a bug fix. One way to run your announcement list utilizing Authorized Senders is to rewrite the From: header, so all messages sent to your mailing list use the List Owner in the From: header, no matter what Authorized Sender sent the message. 

Look for the radio button labeled, 

B<Rewrite From header to List Owner> 

in Bridge

Another option available is to preserve the original From: header so that any replies go to that address, rather than the List Onwer. The issue was that the From: header wasn't correctly managed to deal with DMARC restrictions. 

Say you have an Authorized Sender that's using a Gmail account, and you've set up your mailing list to send using your own SMTP server. Sending a mass mailing from your own server with (for example) a Gmail address in the From: header won't work. You'll need to instead send the message  "on behalf of" the original sender, just like we do for discussion lists. In past versions, this wasn't happening, and in v11.7- it now is. Rejoice!

Look for the radio button labeled, 

B<Rewrite From header to be "on behalf of" List Owner> 
 
in Bridge. 

=head4 Don't rewrite the From header for email addresses from certain domains

We've also added an option to list domains that you would not like this rewrite to happen, just in case your mail system has already allowed certain additional domains to be sent through it.

Look for textbox labeled, 

B<Don't rewrite From header for the following domains: (one domain per line)> 

=head4 Set the Reply-To: header

The ability to set the Reply-To header to the List Owner or the original sender (or no one!) has been kept, even though the From: header need to be sent "On Behalf Of".

=head4 Mention the original sender

Similar to what you're able to do already for discussion lists, you can now set your mailing list to mention who the original authorized sender was, who sent the message. This option can be enabled (default) and disabled in Bridge for both announce-only and discussion lists. Look for the checkbox labeled: 

B<Mention the original sender of the message at the top of the message itself>

in Bridge. 

Under the hood, this is implemented using Dada Mail's template tags, which you can use too, in your own custom mass mailing layout. See our docs on Dada Mail's email template tag syntax to learn more:

email messages, below your physical address and phone number. 

=head3 Theme being used now displayed in Admin Menu

=head3 Better error reporting in individual mass mailing log

In an effort to more easily debug problems with mass mailings, the individual mass mailing log will show more errors.

=head3 Better error reporting for problems with messages received with the Bridge plugin

In an effort to more easily debug problems with messages received via the Bridfge plugin, more information 
will be printed to the error log, when a problem occurs. 

=head3 New Safety Checks When Removing All List Members

In Dada Mail, it's very easy to remove all list members from the, B<Membership: View> screen. 
Although an alert box does come up when you click this button, 
it's not entirely clear if Global Unsubscribe is enabled for your installation. 
If it is, removing all your members from one list may remove all your members from all your mailing lists, 
which most likely is not what you want to do. 

To help with this issue, we've disabled this button per mailing list. You can re-enabled it in the, B<Membership: Options> screen. 
We've also put a alert box on the top of the, B<Membership: View> to remind you if you Global Unsubscribe is enabled. The alert box that comes up if you do try to remove all your members will again remind you that global unsubscribe is enabled. 

All the above also applies to the Global Black List, and you'll get similar notifications in the interface if you try to remove any of the blacklisted members, and have the Global Black List enabled.

=head1 Internal Changes 

=head2 Moving Away from MIME::Lite::HTML to MIME::Entity

The largest change in this release is moving away from using the, C<MIME::Lite::HTML> module. 
C<MIME::Lite::HTML> was an important part of Dada Mail, as it was used to embed images into email messages
and was the original engine that turned URL's into email messsages.
 
But, C<MIME::Lite> and therefore C<MIME::Lite::HTML> are known to be a little buggy, and aren't well supported
these days, so we've moved to it's larger brother: C<MIME::Entity>. C<MIME::Entity> and the rest of the C<MIME::Tools>
collection of modules is already well-entrenched within Dada Mail's codebase. 
Removing MIME::Lite::HTML also removes a substantial amount of redundant code. 

=head2 jQuery upgraded from v2.1.4 to v2.2.4


=head1 11.5.1

This is mostly a bug-fix release for issues found in the v11.5.0 release of Dada Mail. 
There a few small features to look out for: 

=head2 Features

=head3 Cleaned up Discussion List Moderation Screen

Dada Mail primarly moderates discussion list messages via an email interface: copies of messages that require 
moderation are sent to all the Moderators via an email notification. The moderators can then approve or deny 
a message from being sent. 

We've now made it easier to see awaiting messages within the List Control Panel. Under, B<Plugins/Extensions: Bridge>, 
look under B<Moderation> for a button that will allow you to view the messages awaiting moderation. This button 
will only be enabled, if Moderation is also enabeled. Clicking this button will take you to a new screen which will list all messages that are awaiting moderation in a table, in descending order by date. 

For each message, you will have the ability to approve, deny, or simply delete the message from the moderation queue (no notification will be sent to the subscriber if you choose the latter). You may also re-send the moderation notification to all your moderators, where they may view the message itself.

=head3 Easier to see errors during installation 

Although it's rare, sometimes the installer doesn't run correctly. When this happens, it's sometimes useful to look 
into the error log, to see what happened (and report the problems to us!). Finding this error log wsn't very well documented, so we've fixed that problem, and made the installer a little more aggressive on displaying errors in a way that's more easy to work with. 

=head3 Old backups of directories in dada_mail_support_files directory now removed automatically

Dada Mail's installer makes backups of directories found in the, C<dada_mail_support_files> directory. The problem is 
that there's nothign that ever removes these backups, so they start piling up and taking up disk space. 

The installer will now remove all but the last three directory backups, per named directory.

=head1 11.5.0

=head2 Features

=head3 Testers List

Test sending out your mass mailing is a great idea to do, before you commit to sending out the message to your entire mailing list. 

In past versions, Dada Mail could only send only send a test mass mailing to one email address at one time.

Starting with v11.5.0, Dada Mail can send a test mass mailing to multiple addresses at once.

By default, this list of test recipients can be created per draft message by typing in the email addresses in the same text box that previously only supported one email address. By default, up to ten email addresses may be added to this text box, and sent a test mass mailing.

Additionally, a Testers List may be enabled so that the same list of addresses can be sent a test mass mailing for all draft messages. This sublist can be administrated simnilarly to your main Subscribers list. 

Here's where to find all these new enhancements: 

When drafting a new mass mailing, click on the, B<Options> tab, then click on the, B<Testing> tab. This is where you'll find the text box to list the addresses you would like your test mass mailing to be sent to. By default, you can enter up to ten addresses (read on to find out how to change this default). Separate each address you enter in the text box by commas, spaces, and/or new lines. 

When you're ready to send out a test mass mailing, click the button at the top of the screen labeled, B<Send Test>. The screen will refresh to show you the mass mailing monitor for your test mass mailing. A button will be shown at the top of the screen labeled, B<Return to Editing Draft>. Click this button to return to your draft message, so that you can continue editing the message, or to send the mass mailing out for real. I<(Note: In previous versions of Dada Mail, you would never leave the draft editing screen, as only one email address would be sent the test mass mailing.)>

To enable the Testers List, go to B<Membership: Options> in the list control panel. Find the section labeled, B<Testers List> to see the options available to you. Check the option labeled, B<[x] Activate Testers List> to enable the Testers List. 

Options below this checkbox will allow you to specifiy if there's a limit to how many addresses you may have in your Testers list as well as what that limit is. The limit set here will also affect how many addresses you can add to the text box in the drafts screen, per draft message. 

Once enabled, the Testers list can be accessed in the list control panel under, B<Membership View>. Click the tab labeled, "Testers" to see add/edit/remove addresses in this sublist. 

And once enabled, you can toggle between using your Testers list and a unique list of addresses per draft message in the draft message itself. Revisit the B<Options: Testers> tab(s) to now see the two options available. Select, B<Send to Testers sublist> to send your test mass mailing to the Testers. 

Sending a test message can be useful in a few different ways. With a test mass mailing, you can make sure that delivery is working to specific addresses, domains, and email services, and that the email message itself is displaying correctly on a spectrum of services and devices. This can also help you get a checkoff of the content an design of your mass mailing if you're working within a team. 

There are a few things that happen differently when sending out a test mass mailing. To start, none of the recipients of a test mass mailing will be able to unsubscribe through the test mass mailing. Also, test mass mailings will not be tracked for things like Opens, Clickthroughs, or Bounces.

This release has changes mostly that relate to the Tracker plugin: 

=over

=item * Support to add a Google Maps API Key has been added

=item * Ability to log full (rather than anonymized) IP addresses has been restored

=back

=head2 Features

=head3 Google Maps API Key support

On June 1st, Google will require anyone that accesses their maps API to get an API Key (and thus, sign up for Google Cloud Platform). Dada Mail uses the map charts to show location data, 
and this falls under using their maps. Rather than remove this feature from Dada Mail, we've 
instead added support to add this Maps API Key into Dada Mail.

You can grab an API key using these instructions: 

L<https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key> 

Once you have a key, you may add it to Dada Mail through the Dada Mail Installer - look for a checkbox labeled, 

B<Configure Google Maps>

Check it, then add your Google Maps API Key in the textbox labeled, 

B<Google Maps API Key>

If this API Key is not available, none of the map charts will be shown, but tabular data will be available where that makes sense. You can also disable showing maps in the Tracker plugin with a new option labeled, 

B<Show maps in message reports> 

=head3 Configure Handling Personally Identifiable Information (PII) 

Dada Mail now has the ability - install-wide to control just what personally identifying information is allowed to be collected. New options are available in the installer under the option, 

B<Configure Handling Personally Identifiable Information (PII)>

Options are: 

=head4 Allow email addresses to be logged for tracking/analytical purposes 

B<Default:> I<disabled>

If enabled, Dada Mail will then enable an option in the Tracker plugin labeled, 

B<Track with email addresses> 

Which may be enabled/disabled per mailing list. 

When this option is enabled, the Tracker plugin will log and report data that includes the email address. 

If disabled, the following message will be shown in the Tracker plugin, 

     Disabled. Logging email addresses for analytical purposes is not enabled. 


=head4 	Log complete/anonymized IP addresses 

B<Default:> I<anonymized>

Dada Mail by default anonymizes IP addresses before logging them. If you would like to enable
saving the actual IP address being reported, you now have the option to do so. 

Make sure to be educated on these options - if you need to follow the guidelines put forth by the GDPR, neither tracking with an email address, nor logging IP addresses should be things you should be doing, unless you've been given consent to do so. See also 

L<https://dadamailproject.com/d/gdpr_guide.pod.html>


=head4 IP addresses and the Tracker plugin 

One of the places that full IP addresses are useful, is when reporting where opens, clickthroughs, etc are done geographically, and Dada Mail reports this using it's map charts. 

If IP address logging is anonymized, this location lookup by IP address is negatively impacted. 

This is now noted in the Tracker plugin, and a new option is available to simple enable/disable maps from being shown completely. Look for the option labeled, 

B<Show location data in message reports>

=head1 11.3.0

=head2 Changes

=head3 Google+ Support Dropped

Google+ has been effectively shuttered, so we've removed support for it from the app. 

=head2 Features

=head3 Enhanced One-Click Unsubscription support via Email Headers (per RFC 8058)

Dada Mail has supported "one-click unsubscribe" when a user clicsk one of the unsubscribe buttons/links in the mailing list message, 
as well as via the C<List-Unsubscribe> email header. The latter of which isn't shown directly to a subscriber, 
but may be used by their mail reader to provide a mechanism to unsubscribe through it's own UI. 

There's a problem though with this C<List-Unsubscribe> header: 

Sometimes the unsubscription link in the header is visted by anti-virus software which, 
after visiting the link will unsubscribe the user without any direct action from the subscriber themselves! 
This leads to all sort of administration problems, as list owners are losing subscribers who would like very much to stay on their mailing list. 

Dada Mail now supports one-click unsubscribe via the C<List-Unsubscribe> header without this problem happening. 
This is done by following RFC 8058, which provides a mechanism to utilize one-click unsubscribe via the headers, but stops the scenario described above from happening. 
 
Any email reader that supports RFC 8058 will allow your subscribers one-click unsubscribe. 
Any mail reader that doesn't support this mechanism will still be able to use the fallback, 
email-only option, also located in the mail header. Either way, incorrect unsubscriptions throught his mechanism shouldn't happen anymore. 
In our testing, we've found that most email readers actually only support emailing the list owner, 
when a user clicks the email reader-provided unsubscribe link. 

=head4 Enhanced List-Unsubscribe header email-only option

If the above mechanism isn't supported by the mail reader, there's a good chance that the fallback is. That fallback being: the mail reader sends an actual email message to the list owner. This email message option has also now been made a bit more useful. In past versions of Dada Mail, an email would be sent to the list owner, telling them the address that wants to be removed as well as the list they should be removed from. 
It was up to the list owner to go through the list control panel to remove this address. 

Starting with v11.3.1, the unsubscription link itself needed to unsubscribe the address from the list 
will be embedded within the email message the list owner receives, 
so all they have to do now is click that link. 

=head4 List-Unsubscribe header can now be enabled/disabled

If one decides instead to not have the C<List-Unsubscribe> header available at all, there is a new option to 
not enable/disable it from being used. 
This option is available in the list control panel under, 

B<Mass Mailing: Options: Headers:> I<Use, "List-Unsubscribe" headers>

=head4 References: 

L<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8058>

=head3 New Options to Complete Unsubscriptions

To coincide with the enhancements to the C<List-Unsubscribe> header, we've expanded the options on what happens when a subscriber clicks the unsubscription buttons/links in mailing list messages themselves.

The three options are now: 

=head4 One-Click Unsubscription

Once a subscriber clicks on a unsubscription link/button in the mailing list message, they'll be unsubscribed right away, with no 
further action by the user. Super convenient for the subscriber! 
And one we suggest, especially since the enhancements to the C<List-Unsubscribe> header
have been made and the problem with anti-virus software getting in the way have now been worked out. 

One issue with this option though is that a user may inadvertantly click the unsubscription button/link, or forward the mailing list message to 
someone else, that then clicks that same button/link. Yikes!

=head4 Click a link/button in Dada Mail

Once a subscriber clicks on a unsubscription link/button in the mailing list message, 
they will be presented with a screen, that just asks them to click a link/button to complete the unsubscription. 
This method may help with people inadvertantly clicking the unsubscribe link/buttons in the mailing list message by mistake. It's the option selected by default. This option is also the newest option added. 

=head3 Fill in the email address, the submit a form

Once a subscriber clicks on a unsubscription link/button in the mailing list message, they will be present with a screen with a form in it, that 
just asks them to fill in their email address to complete the unsubscription. 

This option is a good one, if you're running a discussion mailing list where email messages are commonly replied to/forwarded to other members.
 
The unsubscription buttons/links embedded in the message may be clicked upon by a different user than the one that received the message, and this simple
form can help stop unsubscriptoions done inadvertantly. 

All these options work ndependently to the "one-click unsubscribe" support through the C<List-Unsubsribe> header, which doesn't requires (and cannot have!) any user intervention. 

=head3 Bounce Handler Enhancements

=head4 IMAP Support Added

Set up the Bounce Handler to connect to your Bounce Handler Email address via IMAP. 
This additional option (along with original option of connecting via POP3) gives you more flexibility on how to connect 
to your Bounce Handler Email address to help fit more email hosting scenarios. 
For example, 
those who are using Microsoft Exchange to administrate email may find better success using IMAP,
rather than POP3. 

Option to select B<IMAP> is available in the Dada Mail Installer. 

IMAP support requires that you separately install the C<Net::IMAP::Simple> CPAN Perl module, 
or install/upgrade the C<Bundle::DadaMail> CPAN Perl Module. 

=head3 Instagram Support Added

Add a link to your Instagram profile in your Mailing List Information, the link will be shown in your
mailing list messages, along with Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, and your website links.

This is mostly a bug-fix release for issues found in the v11.2.6 release of Dada Mail. A few small changes and features did sneak in: 

=head2 Features

=head3 Show all profile fields in closed (invite only), private mailing list invitation subscription forms

By default, closed/private lists can still invite subscibers, but the subscription form does not show any 
profile fields. This option, found in: B<Membership: Options>, will allow you to show those fields. 

=head3 Number of Profile Fields shown in the admin menu

If you're wondering how many, or even if you have any profile fields, that information is now shown in the 
admin menu itself, saving you a click. 

=head2 Changes

=head3 Log Viewer Plugin: order of logs in popup menu

The following logs will now always be shown first (if the log is available):

=over

=item * Usage Log

=item * Error Log

=item * Bounce Handler Log

=item * Cronjob Output

=back

Then, any other log will be shown - most likely, "Mass Mailing" logs. These logs will stop NOT be in any useful order, but that issue will be addressed in a future release. This is currently an open issue:

=head2 Features

=head3 Set a default version (HTML, Plaintext) for mass mailing authoring

Sometimes, you want to send only PlainText mass mailings. 

This new feature makes this much easier to configure. In v11.2.1 (and above), go to: 

B<Mass Mailing: Options> 

Under, 

B<Formatting>

set, 

B<Default to authoring:>

to,

B<PlainText Version>

Doing so will: 

=over

=item * select, "PlainText Version" tab by default, instea of "HTML Version""

=item * select, "Write/Paste Text by default" in the PlainText Version tab

=item * select, "Do not send an HTML version (only PlainText version)" in the HTML Version tab

=head1 11.2.0

=head2 Features

=head3 Drafts/Send a Message UI redesign/shuffle

The Send a Message part of the app has been given a healthy UI refresh - some things to look for: 

=head4 Prompt before leaving screen

If you try to leave a draft message screen without saving your changes, 
you'll be reminded of this with a prompt. 
This should help stop you from inadvertently leaving the screen prematurely. 

=head4 Default screen: All Drafts/Stationery/Schedules

When you log into your mailing list's list control panel, 
the default screen is now the  B<All Drafts/Stationery/Schedules> screen, 
rather than the B<Send a Message> screen. 
This is to make loading of the list control panel go a little faster, 
since the Send a Message screen is very complex, 
and takes a while to fully load. 

=head4 Send a Webpage screen removed (but all features moved to Send a Message)

Having two screens that can send a mass mailing seems like one too many, 
so we've removed the B<Send a Webpage> screen. 
Don't worry - all the features on that screen have been added to the B<Send a Message> screen, 
so no features have been removed. 
What has been removed is a lot of duplicate code in the backend. 
Getting rid of this code makes things just that much more simplier to keep well-maintained. 

A mass mailing message can be created by: 

=over

=item * Writing or pasting content into the rich text editor

=item * fetching the message from a specific URL

=item * creating the message from a RSS/Atom feed

=back

from the Send a Message screen

=head4 "All Drafts/Stationery/Schedules" screen changes

Individual Drafts/Stationery/Schedules now how a button to B<Preview> the message, 
without having to open them individually for editing. 

All messages are now sorted by creation date, 
rather than last-modified date, 
and this creation date is shown. 

=head4  Mass Mailing Top Menu Changes

B<Send a Message> has been renamed B<+ New Draft Message>. 
Clicking it will B<always> create a new draft message. 
In previous versions of Dada Mail, 
any previous draft message would get loaded. 
This was problematic, 
if you had more than one draft message 
- things got confusing on just what draft message was now loaded. 
This menu item has moved one item below in the top menu bar of B<Mass Mailing> 

B<Drafts/Stationery/Schedules> has been renamed, B<All Drafts/Stationery/Schedules>
and has been moved to the top of the B<Mass Mailing> top bar menu. 
As has been mentioned, 
this is the defalt screen now when you log into your mailing list's list control panel. 

=head3 New Option: Save Sent Draft Messages as Stationery

Many times, people would like to re-use a previously sent message for a new mass mailing. Now, 
Dada Mail has an option to save previously sent messages you've authored in the list control panel as
new stationery messarges, which you can then use to create a new draft message from. 

=head3 New Ignore Bounces Sublist

Some users have reported problems with addresses they know are valid, 
but which that bounce anyways: 
there's a (hopefully) temporary problem on the receiving mail server. 

To counter this, 
Dada Mail now allows you to set up a list of addresses that the Bounce Handler 
will not process as it does usually. 
Instead, 
bounces from the addresses will just be ignored. 

Addresses can be added simonilar to the Black List and White List: 
segments of addresses are allowed. 

For example,
if you want to ignore a specific email address, 
you can. 
If you want to ignore all address from a domain, 
you can do that as well. 

=head3 RESTful API Support for Update Profile Fields

The RESTful API now supports updating profile fields 
(look for, C<update_profile_fields> in the API docs) 
for an individual email address at a time. 

=head1 11.1.3

=head2 Features

=head3 Markdown Support

Many pieces of plain text copy in Dada Mail are now treated as Markdown markup, and will be treated as such if/when the copy
is used as HTML. 

List Settings that will get this treatment include: 

=over

=item * Mailing List Description

=item * Mailing List Physical Address

=item * Mailing List Privacy Policy

=back

Along with these list settings, mass mailing messages that are authored in plaintext will be treated as Markdown markup if they 
are converted to HTML.

recommended to upgrade.

Unfortunately, I had to choose one setting to work with one feature, and make the other setting use a different key. 

I've chosen to have the "backlink" URL and Nmae to use different keys.
