=head1 Dada Mail Changelog for version 4.x.x

=head1 4.2.0

=head2 Changes 4.2.0

=head3 Dada Mail Installer

Dada Mail now comes with an installer - manually setting up and configuring
Dada Mail is now longer needed. Heavens be praised. 

Dada Installer directions may be found at: 

L<http://dadamailproject.com/support/documentation/manually_install_dada_mail.pod.html>

Upgrade instructions may be found at: 

L<http://dadamailproject.com/support/documentation/upgrade_dada_mail.pod.html>

The installar script may also be run via the command line - instructions can be 
found on how to use it, by invoking the script with the, C<--help> flag, 

 shell>./installer.cgi --help

=head4 Installation Terminology Changes

The, "Advanced" Installation of Dada Mail is just known as a, "Manual" installation
of Dada Mail.

The Dada Mail Installer will install Dada Mail the same way as one would install 
Dada Mail manually. Directions may be found here: 

L<http://dadamailproject.com/support/documentation/manually_install_dada_mail.pod.html>

The, "Basic" Installation method is not recommended or supported. If upgrading from a, "Basic" installation, 
it's recommended to move to a more contemporary installation setup: 

L<http://dadamailproject.com/support/documentation/basic_two_contemporary_installation.pod.html>

=head2 Setup Info Screen 

The, "Setup Info" Screen, that you can access using this URL: 

L<http://example.com/cgi-bin/dada/mail.cgi?f=setup_info>

has been completely rewritten. In light of the Installer, it does not attempt to help 
configure Dada Mail for you, but will tell you what type of installation it recognizes, 
 will present to you the entire contents of your, C<dada/DADA/Config.pm> file as well as your C<.dada_config> 
file and will show you how all config variables are being interpreted. 

=head3 $ADMIN_MENU Changes 

The $ADMIN_MENU variable has been changed to add the, "Dada Mail Setup Info" menu item. It looks like this: 

	{-Title      => '<!-- tmpl_var PROGRAM_NAME --> Setup Info',
	 -Title_URL  => "$S_PROGRAM_URL?f=setup_info",
	 -Function   => 'setup_info',
	 -Activated  => 1,
	},

=head3 MySQL 4-specific schema REMOVED

The MySQL schema shipped for Dada Mail, specifically for v4 of MySQL has been removed. 
The reason for the schema was more because of UTF-8 incompatibilities, rather 
than problems with this version of MySQL v4. 


=head2 Bug Fixes

=head3 Profile Email Addresses aren't normalized for case sensitivity

http://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues#issue/60

=head3 PlainText Backend - subscribed addresses with a, ' (single quote) will disrupt subscriptions

=head1 4.1.0

=head2 Changes 4.1.0

=head3 Screen Cache Working Again, Enabled by Default

The Screen Cache API allows Dada Mail to save fully-rendered Dada Mail screens 
that are commonly viewed. 

=head4 Enabled by Default

The Screen Cache is enabled by default, via setting the C<$SCREEN_CACHE> config variable, to C<1> 

=head4 Changes to the $ADMIN_MENU

A new entry under the, "Plugins" heading has been added to the $ADMIN_MENU variable in the I<Config.pm>, 
I<dada/DADA/Template/templates/example_dada_config.tmpl> and, I<dada/extras/examples/example_dada_config.txt>

=head3 Optimizations in Mass Mailing Speeds

Small Tweaks have been made to the Mass Mailing code in Dada Mail through code profiling
 which should positively impact Mass Mailing Speeds, upwards of .10 to .25 seconds 
faster, per message. 

=head3 Social Bookmarking/Link Sharing Buttons for archive screens Enabled by Default

Older, unused social bookmarking sites have been removed (as well as Fark, because,well...)

The Facebook link sharing button has also been added.

=head1 4.0.5

=head2 Changes 4.0.5

=head3 POP3 and SMTP Passwords Saved in List Settings 

I<This is not a security bug/issue/notice - rather, this is a bug that was introduced
with the full UTF-8 support.> 

The binary-in-nature encrypted passwords saved by Dada Mail in the List Settings 
table/files in Dada Mail may have become unusable/corrupted with version 4.0.3
and/or 4.0.4 of Dada Mail. 

If you are having trouble/an impossible time using any of the POP3 or SMTP connection
stuff in Dada Mail, including Dada Bridge, Mystery Girl (Bounce Handler) or POP-before-SMTP
and/or SMTP SASL authentication - or even the Twitter stuff, you may be bitten by this bug. 
4.0.5 should provide a fix for this problem, B<BUT> (big but), 4.0.5 could potentialy I<break any 
currently stored passwords>. 

The fix will be to simply re-save the correct password, I<after> you've upgraded to 
4.0.5. 

New users of Dada Mail will not be affected by this problem.  

This problem B<does not impact> your List Password, or the Dada Mail Root Password - 
both of which are saved in a one-way encryption, that is separate from the way 
POP3/SMTP passwords are saved in Dada Mail. 

=head2 Bug Fixes 4.0.5

=head3 Subscriptions are not logged in the usage log. 

http://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/closed#issue/37

=head3 Subscribers can be subscribed more than once to the black list

http://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/closed#issue/38

=head3 Dada Bridge sending broken if, "Strip attachments that have the following file ending or mime-type:" is enabled

This bug wasn't actually closed with this release, but from a previous release. It has
though, been confirmed to be closed with this release. 

=head1 4.0.4

=head2 Changes 4.0.4

=head3 UTF-8 Issues

=head4 MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite schema changes

Some compatibility issues cropped up, regarding UTF-8/unicode character set/encoding 
in re: to the SQL schemas. The schemas for all supported SQL backends have been 
modified to better work, mostly by changing fields with type, C<text(320)>, to type, 
C<varchar(80)>. Other notes have been added to the UTF-8 FAQ. 

=head4 dada3_to_dada4_sql.pl changes

Along with looking into changing the default schema in Dada Mail, the v3 to v4
migration script will now make the necessary schema and character set changes. 

The character encoding changes and SQL schema changes could potentially be desctructive, 
so we do, in fact, highly encourage you to make a backup of the entire database, 
before running the migration tool. Most notably, the character encoding change 
does not work perfectly. If your data contains a lot of non-Latin1 characters, we'd 
highly suggest you do your own ASCII/Latin1 to UTF-8 migration, before upgrading 
your Dada Mail. 

If you are running a verion of Dada Mail 4.0.0 to 4.0.3, you'll still need to 
make those schema changes manually if you're having trouble (exactly what to do, 
including example SQL is located in the UTF-8 FAQ). 


=head2 Bug Fixes 4.0.4

=head3 Dada Bridge always reports that IO::Socket::SSL isn't available

http://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/#issue/36

=head3 "Use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)" option sometimes not available, even though appropriate CPAN module installed

http://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/#issue/35

=head3 Dada Bridge will always say that SpamAssassin isn't available

http://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/closed#issue/34

=head3 Moderation broken on Dada Bridge

http://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/closed#issue/33

=head3 Fallback Variables aren't used. 

http://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/closed#issue/32

=head3 "Save, Then Test Your Sending Preferences..." button broken in Sending Preferences

http://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/closed#issue/31

=head2 CPAN Modules 4.0.4

=over

=item * CGI::Sessoion upgraded to: 4.42

CGI::Session handles all session management in Dada Mail. 

=item * List-Utils Scalar-Utils

The CPAN perl modules, Scalar::Util and List::Util are included with Dada Mail, but aren't actively used (and are probably outdated),
 so that any server-wide installed versions will be used, instead. This is because the XS versions of these modules are needed for POP/SMTP 
SSL connections and having these usable by default, breaks SSL connections. The directories, 

 dada/DADA/perllib/List

and, 

 dada/DADA/perllib/Scalar

have been renamed, 

 dada/DADA/perllib/List-remove_to_install

and, 

 dada/DADA/perllib/Scalar-remove_to_install

renaming them back to their original name will make them, "active"

=back


=head1 4.0.3

=head2 Changes 4.0.3

=head3 Unicode/UTF-8 Work 

We have worked very, very hard to get Dada Mail working with UTF-8/Unicode.

We think we did a pretty good job and you'll have a most amazing experience
 when comparing this version to any previous version of Dada Mail (ever), but 
there may be tiny things still to work out. 

We need to know about them, don't be shy! 

=head4 SQL table schema changes!

People who upgrade to 4.0.3 (and any version afterwards, until things change!) 
should note that the MySQL and PostgreSQL Table Schemas have changed! 

You may need to update your own tables, to support UTF-8 (if they aren't 
already in that encoding).

=head4 See Also:

If you're upgrading, please read over the updated UTF-8/Unicode FAQ: 

http://dadamailproject.com/support/documentation/features-UTF-8.pod.html

If you're doing a new install, there's nothing you need to know, Dada Mail should
work well out of the box in re: to UTF-8/Unicode stuff. 

=head3 Changes to Default List Settings

We've changed a few of the default list settings, hopefully so that everyone 
has a more pleasant experience, right off the bat: 

=head4 Activate Black List

We've enabled the setting to active the Black List, by default. 

We're also enabling the below settings: 

=over

=item * Move Unsubscribed Subscribers Automatically to the Black List

=item * Continue to Allow Subscriptions From Subscribers of Black Listed Addresses

=back

You still have the option to change new lists to the previous behavior and already created lists 
will have their previous behavior, if Black List Settings have already been edited.  

=head3 Print List-Specific Headers option Removed

The option, B<Print List-Specific Headers> has been removed from, I<Mail Sending -Advanced Sending Preferences> 
has been removed, I<but> the functionality has B<not>. All 
mailing list messages will have these headers. 

=head3 Send Unsubscription Confirmation Emails (Closed-Loop Opt-Out) - disabled by default

B<Send Unsubscription Confirmation Emails (Closed-Loop Opt-Out)> has been disabled by default (you can still enable it) 

This option, when enabled, requires that when someone wants to unsubscribe, 
they have to confirm this unsubscription by clicking on the unsubscription confirmation link
in a URL sent their subscribed address. 

When disabled (the new default), they simply have to fill out the subscribe/unsubscribe form. 

=head2 Subscription and Unsubscription links now include an Email Address

When available, both the Subscription and Unsubscription links will have the potential subscriber's
(or unsubscriber's) email address in the link itself, so that the user does not have to do the two-step
of first following the link and then typing in their email address. 
 
These links are created per-subscriber (or potential sub/unsub), when you use the: 

 <!-- tmpl_var list_subscribe_link -->

or, 

 <!-- tmpl_var list_unsubscribe_link --> 

tags. Previously, these tags only provided a link to the subscription/unsubscription form, 
without the email address embedded within the link itself. There is no way to revert this behaviour, 
but you can still roll your own links, like this: 

Subscription Link: 

 <!-- tmpl_var PROGRAM_URL -->/s/<!-- tmpl_var list_settings.list --> 

Unsubscription Link: 

 <!-- tmpl_var PROGRAM_URL -->/u/<!-- tmpl_var list_settings.list -->

=head2 Unsubscription Links Now Mandatory for Mass Mailing Messages

Dada Mail will now do a quick check to make sure that there is a Dada Mail 
Unsubscription link in your mass mailing messages, before sending them out. 

If one is not found, one will be automatically appended to the end of your message. 

It will not be very fancy. 

We suggest that you make sure that you have a real, valid, Dada Mail unsubscription link
in your Mailing List Messages.

=head1 4.0.2

=head2 Changes 4.0.2

=head3 Dada Bridge: "Allow Open Discussion List" option always viewable

For whatever reason, the, "Allow Open Discussion List" option wasn't viewable, until
you first enabled discussion lists. It will now *always* be viewable, as long as the 
Plugin Config Param, C<Allow_Open_Discussion_List> is set to, C<1>

=head3 Dada Bridge: New Plugin Config Param: Check_Multiple_From_Addresses

A new Plugin Config Paramater called, C<Check_Multiple_From_Addresses> has been added
and has a default value of, C<1>. When enabled, messages that have more than one 
sender aren't supported by Dada Bridge and these messages will be ignored. 

Set this paramater to, C<0> to revert to the previous behavior. 

=head3 Mail Sending - "broken pipe" catch removed

Dada Mail had a very simple test to make sure mail using the sendmail command was successful, 
by looking at any error messages created from sending mail this way. If a, "broken pipe" 
message was found while sending a mass mailing, a mass mailing would be stopped, 
and would be picked up and sending would be attempted starting at the same address
that gave the error. The complete logged error may look like this: 

	[Mon Jan  4 16:40:08 2010] mail.cgi: Pro Dada 4.0.1 Warning: 
	[Mon Jan  4 16:40:08 2010] mail.cgi:                          didn't close pipe to '|/usr/sbin/sendmail -t -fbounces@example.com' while 
	[Mon Jan  4 16:40:08 2010] mail.cgi:                          attempting to send a message to: '"My Mailing List" <me@example.com> because:' Broken pipe at ..//DADA/MailingList/Schedules.pm line 808
	[Mon Jan  4 16:40:08 2010] mail.cgi: Broken Pipe error! returning -1 - Mass Mailing should be exit()ed! at ..//DADA/MailingList/Schedules.pm line 808
	[Mon Jan  4 16:40:08 2010] mail.cgi: [listshortname]  Mailout:<20100104164007.54315974@nicky510.com> Bailing out of Mailing for now - last message was unable to be sent! exit()ing! at ..//DADA/MailingList/Schedules.pm line 808

This behavior is problematic, since the, "broken pipe" error can happen, even 
if a message (or part of a message) is actually sent. Sometimes this happens if you 
have a message that contains a dot by itself on one line, like this: 

 .

If this is problematic to you (messages being cut off because of a lone dot on one line) 
and you're using the sendmail command to send messages, consider changing the C<$MAIL_SETTINGS> 
and, C<$MASS_MAIL_SETTINGS> Config variables to include the, C<-i> flag, like this: 

 $MAIL_SETTINGS      = "|$MAILPROG -t -i";
 $MASS_MAIL_SETTINGS = "|$MAILPROG -t -i";

=head2 4.0.0 Features

=over

=item * Multiple List Sending

Support has be re-introduced to allow Multiple List Sending. See the separate docs on this feature: 

L<http://dadamailproject.com/support/documentation/feature-multiple_list_sending.pod.html>

=item *  Subscriber Profiles

Please see the docs specifically about Dada Mail Subscriber Profiles:

L<http://dadamailproject.com/support/documentation/feature-profiles.pod.html>

=item *  Subscriber Profile Field Labels

You can now have a, "Label" to your Subscriber Profile Field. A label is what's 
visibly shown and is not now created from the field's name.

=item * Subscription Approval System (Experimental) 

You can now have an, "open to all to subscribe" mailing list, that still requires approval from the list owner. 

Please see the docs specifically about this new feature: 

L<http://dadamailproject.com/support/documentation/features-subscription_approval.pod.html>

=item * Slightly better UTF-8 support. 

This version of Dada Mail is currently shipped with all charsets and encodings to, "UTF-8", but Dada Mail itself is far from support this character set completely. 

This is because it is hard.

Please see the docs specifically about this new feature: 

L<http://dadamailproject.com/support/documentation/features-UTF-8.pod.html>

=item * Twitter Support

Yup. Dada Mail can Tweet. More information: 

L<http://dadamailproject.com/support/documentation/features-twitter_support.pod.html>

=item * CKeditor Support (Experimental) 

We're experimenting with bringing CKeditor support to Dada Mail. Please see the embedded Config.pm docs about this: 

L<http://dadamailproject.com/support/documentation/Config.pm.html#ckeditor_integration____ckeditor_url__experimental__>

=item * Mass Mailings keep their own log

This means, that anything about the mass mailing is logged for that specific mass mailing - 
this should hopefully make debugging a little bit easier. 

=item * View the Mass Mailing Log from the Mailing Monitor

There's a new link entitled, "Open Mass Mailing Log in a New Window -> "

This functionality is currently extremely rough, but is a pretty easy way to see what, in fact, is going on. 

=item * Slightly Smarter Error Handling for failing sendmail mailings

We've started catching sendmail errors and, if we find an error, we'll exit out of the 
sending process, for the message to be automatically picked up and the last email 
that had a problem, to be tried again. It's currently not perfect, but it's a very small 
step forward.

=item * Clone Settings

You can now clone the settings from one list, to another list, in the, "Create a New List" screen. 

=item * Remove All Subscribers

You can now Remove all subscribers at once in the, I<Manage List - View Subscribers> screen. 

=item * prototype.js/Scriptalicious Support

For the most part, AJAX stuff in Dada Mail has been replaced by the prototype.js 
and Scriptalicious Javascript Libraries. 

=item * Black List Matching

If it wasn't clear or official before, it should be now:

The black list matching does not work with matching strings, but will only work to 
match the user or domain of an email address or the entire email address. These are valid black list entries: 

=over

=item * matchthis@

=item * @matchthis

=item * matchthis 

=item * matchthis@example.com

=back


=item * Plugins Beatitude - Fetch message from URL has same options as, "Send a Webpage" 

Mostly meaning, you can embed images within the email message itself. 

=item * Plugins Mystery Girl

You can now specify the Port Number of the POP3 mail server

=item * Plugins - Dada Bridge

Simple moderation support is included, to Authorized to moderate messages. 

=item * Plugins - Clickthrough Tracker

The Clickthrough Tracker now has a new SQL backend option for the URL redirect list. 

The log is still in PlainText. 

=item * Extensions - Update Subscriptions - REMOVED

The update_subscriptions.cgi extension has been removed, as its features have been superceded by the Dada Profiles
feature. And then some. 

=back

=head1 CPAN Perl Libraries 

The CPAN Perl Libraries needed for Dada Mail are now being saved within the 
Git Repository of Dada Mail. We don't know if this is the greatest idea, since we don't 
really plan on making changes to this modules. But, we're doing it. If any problems 
occur, please report!


=head1 API
