=head2 Changes 3.0 Beta 3

=head3 Mailing Monitor

Major changes have been enacted in the mailing monitor. 

The index screen on the mailing monitor now has separate columns for: 

=over

=item * Subject

=item * Created

=item * Paused

=item * Queued

=item * Stale

=item * Broken

=back

The mailing monitor also now sorts the mailouts in the order they were created, instead of their line in the queue. The line in queue method was actually crtically confusing (even to me). 

The mailing monitor also handles, "Broken" mailouts better. There were a few notable problems with the previous revision, including: 

=over

=item * Broken Mailouts messed up the queue

If a mailout was broken, it would never leave the mail queue, so any mass mailings waiting to go out would always be stuck; since the default max number of mailouts is, 1 (this number is configurable) 

=item * Mailing monitor broken with a broken mailing

If you had a broken mailing, it wouldn't show up in the mailing monitor index - essentially breaking it, since information was missing. 

=back

Along with these problems, a lack of notice about a broken mailing plagued the entire interface - probably because of wishful thinking that a mailout would I<NEVER> become broken. Proper feedback should now be in place, in the mailing monitor index, individual mailing monitor screens, as well as the detailed and nerdy printout. 

=head3 Mailing Monitor, continued...

Much work has also been done with the mailing monitor, to deal with broken mass mailings. If a mass mailing is seen as broken, it's now also, "paused" to move it out of the way of the mail queue. 

Feedback is terribly wanted to make sure the mailing monitor and coupled auto-pickup functionality is working for you - so let us know!

=head3 Mailing Monitor  responsiveness

The responsiveness of the, pause and resume buttons, as well as seeing if a mailing is queued should be a bit better now, as the status of the mailouts is checked before a batch is begun and after a batch begins. (before it was only afterwards). Queueing, I want to say, was never checked after a mailout began, which really is a bug. 

The individual mailing monitor screens also have a way to turn off the auto-refresh, which can be annoying, if you're attemting to read the, "Verbose Sending Information" in the screen itself; 

=head3 CPAN module Juggling

The included group of CPAN modules known as, B<MIME-Tools> was downgraded in Dada Mail from version 5.426 to version 5.420. One of the reasons was that versions above 5.420 require Perl, version 5.8 to run and we're still spec'ing Dada Mail to be able to run on Perl, version 5.6. Another reason is the newest version has major conflicts with other bundled CPAN modules, as well as site-wide Perl modules, installed from CPAN. It's quite a headache. 

=head3 blog_index.cgi Plugin

The blog_index.cgi plugin has been refreshed and allows you to now embed the HTML it creates via a javascript library, or as straight HTML. A new menu item in the Admin Contol Panel has been added. 

=head3 "Send a Message" API

The API used in the, "Send a Message" screen has been introduced in an... introductory manner, in the, I<Integrating Dada Mail into other Programs> docs: 

L<http://dadamailproject.com/support/documentation/COOKBOOK-integration.pod.html#accessing_the__send_a_list_message_api>

If there's interest, I'll expand on this topic. 

=head3 $MONITOR_MAILOUTS_AFTER_EVERY_EXECUTION

A new Config.pm variable, C<$MONITOR_MAILOUTS_AFTER_EVERY_EXECUTION> was introducted. If set to, C<1>, Dada Mail will call the same code as it does in the Mailing Monitor and auto_pick.pl scripts in the mail.cgi script itself, after its finished with whatever else it has to do. 

B<See also:>

L<http://dadamailproject.com/support/documentation/Config.pm.html#_monitor_mailouts_after_every_execution>

=head3 List Control Panel Menu Enhancements

The List Control Panel's Admin Menu menu items have been tweaked. 

The top level title, I<Customize Feature Set> has been moved below a new top level title, I<Manage List Control Panel>. Underneith this same title is a new menu item labeled, I< Options>

=head3 Customize Feature Set Changes

The option, I<Grey Out Disabled Screens> still greys out the titles on the lost control panel's admin menu, but the text is now clickable. Clicking these links will give you an error page, telling the user they don't have access to this screen. 

The order of some of the menu items have also changed. Most notably, the, B<Plugins> and, B<Extensions> items have been moved to be before the, "About Dada Mail", "Logout" and, "Log Into Another List" items. 

=head2 New Admin Screen: Manage List Control Panel - Options

Currently, it's only functionality is to enable and disable FCKeditor support. This new setting currently does not affect Beatitude (but should).

=head3 Dada Mail Admin Menu

=head3 Dada Mail Queueing Notifications

There are now messages on top of the, Send a Message, Send a Webpage and Send a List Invitation screens to let you know if the limit of 
individual mass mailings has been reached and if the message you're about to send will be queued. This is to help any confusion about why messages don't go out 
right away.
