=head1 Name dada_subscribers_plaintext2sql.pl

=head1 Description

Cute name, huh? 

Basically, this small script takes the information of a Dada Mail plaintext subscription list and ports it to the MySQL format.

Fairly simple and straightforward. 

=head1 How to use this script

=over

=item * Backup Everything

SQL tables, list files (all of them) 

=item * Create the Subscribers SQL table

The SQL statement to run should be saved in a file called I<dada_subscribers.sql> which is located in the I<dada/extras/SQL> directory of the distribution

=item * Set B<DB_TYPE> to the correct SQL type (MySQL, Postgres)

Directions are located in the Config.pm about this, search for, I<$SUBSCRIBER_DB_TYPE>

=item * Fill in %SQL_PARAMS in the Config.pm file

Again, directions should be supplied in the Config.pm file. 

=back

After the above (do not skip a step) are done, make sure Dada Mail is still running by visiting it in your webbrowser. The program should run exactly as before, except no subscribers will be present. 

Upload this script into the same directory that you have the I<mail.cgi> script in, and run it, either from your web browser, or via a shell connection (which is prefered). 

That should be it. 


ps. backup everything.
