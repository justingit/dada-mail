DADA MAIL INSTALL/CONFIGURATION SCRIPT! 


This script has a separate web and command line interface - this help covers
the command line interface. This interface is currently very volatile and we
would really appreciate your help in making it better. The web-based installer
is very easy to use, the command line installer is as easy as most command line 
utilities are (not exactly optimized for a casual user). 

REQUIRED PARAMETERS:

--program_url

	The URL of your Dada Mail, "mail.cgi" script

--dada_root_pass

	The Dada Mail Root Password you'd like to use 
	
--dada_files_loc

	The directory that the installer should create the, ".dada_files" directory 
	under

--backend

	The backend you'd like to use. Can be set to use any of the following: 
	
	default
		Uses the file system, as well as plaintext files and DB Files
		
	mysql 
		Uses a MySQL database
	
	Pg
		Uses a PostgreSQL database
		
If you set, --backend to either, "mysql", or, "Pg" you will also have to pass
the following parameters: 

	--sql_server
		SQL server

	--sql_port
		SQL port - can be set to, "auto" to choose the default port for mysql and Pg

	--sql_database
		The name of your database
	
	--sql_username
		Your mysql username

	--sql_password
		Your mysql password

OPTIONAL PARAMETERS

If performing an partial upgrade or doing some of your installation manually, 
you can tell Dada Mail to skip some of the tests it would usually preform, before 
configuring Dada Mail: 

--dada_files_dir_setup 
	If you pass this parameter with a value of, "auto", you do not need to 
	pass the,  "--dada_files_loc" parameter PROVIDED THAT you're certain that 
	the directory it automatically discovers to create the, ".dada_files" 
	directory structure will be correct. 
	
--skip_configure_SQL
	By default, the installer will make sure the database you pass in, 
	"--sql_database" doesn't already have the tables required for a Dada Mail
	install. If you've already set up these tables (for example, in a previous
	version of Dada Mail) pass this parameter with a value of, "1" to simply 
	use the sql_* parameters you're passing, without attempting to set up 
	the database, itself. 

--skip_configure_dada_files
	If you pass this parameter with a value of, "1", NO other parameter is
	really required, except, "--dada_files_loc" PROVIDED that the directory 
	you pass in that parameter has an already-set up .dada_files directory, 
	including a valid .dada_config file. When passing this parameter, this 
	script will simply change the, "dada/DADA/Config.pm" file to point to 
	the already-created ".dada_files" directory. 
		
OTHER PARAMETERS

--help
	Displays this help doc. Use: 
	
		./install.cgi | less 
		
	(or something similar) so that the script doesn't zoom to the end.
